# Installing Guillotina

Guillotina is a simple Python package so it can be installed with any of the
number of installation methods available to Python.

In the traing here, we will focus on using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
and docker. You can use, for example, buildout as well.


```eval_rst
.. warning::
   Requirements:
    - Python >= 3.6
```


## with pip

```eval_rst
.. note::
   It is recommended you install along with a virtualenv::

      python -m env .
      source ./bin/activate
```


It's as simple as...

```
pip install guillotina
```

Guillotina also provides [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/guillotina/guillotina/).
